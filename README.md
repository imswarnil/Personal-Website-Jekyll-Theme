# imswarnil.com

Personal site and blog for **Swarnil Singhai** — software engineer & filmmaker. A Jekyll site with a self-built design system ("**IM CSS**"), five content collections, a resume page, a cross-collection timeline, and a hand-styled tree sitemap.

Live at [dev.imswarnil.com](https://dev.imswarnil.com) · originally forked from the [Alembic](https://alembic.darn.es/) Jekyll theme and rewritten from the ground up since.

## About

Engineering meets storytelling: this repo is both the source for a working personal site and a small, from-scratch CSS framework (`_sass/im/`) built to re-theme entirely at runtime via CSS custom properties — no rebuild needed to flip between light, dark, or system theme.

## Features

- **IM CSS** — a self-contained, token-driven design system (`_sass/im/`). Every colour, space, radius, and motion value is a `--im-*` custom property, so the whole site re-themes live. See [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) for the full reference.
- **Composed pages, not templates** — what an entry page is made of is `_config.yml` data: `single.parts` (stacked in order), `single.widgets` (the sidebar) and `single.lead`. Every name is a file in `_includes/single/`, `_includes/widgets/` or `_includes/leads/`, so a new part is a file you drop in and name — no layout is edited. Any entry can override all three in its own front matter. See `.claude/skills/personal-site/SKILL.md`.
- **Thirteen content collections** — blog, portfolio, videos (with 9:16 **reels** given their own band and their own two-column page), snippets, prompts, web series + episodes, courses + lessons, podcast, newsletter, travel and a gear shelf — each with its own card design, colour, landing hero and JSON-LD type.
- **Five content collections** — `posts` (Jekyll's native collection), `portfolio` (projects, film and design, by `kind`), `videos`, `snippets`, `prompts` — each with its own card design (GitHub-repo card, video player, VS Code window, chat window, editorial) and JSON-LD schema.
- **`/resume/`** — renders structured resume data straight from `_config.yml` (experience, education, skills, projects, awards), with a print-optimised "Save as PDF" mode.
- **`/timeline/`** — a cross-collection timeline. Add `timeline: true` (and optionally `timeline_note:`) to any post/project/video's front matter and it shows up here, most-recent-first.
- **`/tags/`** — a cross-collection tag index: every tag any entry carries, as a cloud and then a section each, grouped by slug so `Analytics` and `analytics` are one subject. A post's tag chips link straight to their section (`/tags/#t-<slug>`).
- **`/sitemap/`** — a tree-style, collapsible sitemap of every page and collection entry, plus JSON-LD (`WebSite` + `ItemList`) describing the same structure for crawlers. (The machine-readable `/sitemap.xml` is generated separately by `jekyll-sitemap`.)
- **Command-palette search** (`/` to open) plus a full `/search/` page, both reading a generated `assets/search.json` index.
- **Motion system** — dotted/grid background patterns, scroll-reveal via `IntersectionObserver`, native View Transitions on navigation, all gated behind `prefers-reduced-motion` (`_sass/im/_motion.scss`).
- **Configurable chrome** — header (island/full, dropdowns, megamenu), footer (a "big typographic" style with a huge faint wordmark), ads (AdSense, hardened so it can never overflow its container, plus a dismissible floating leaderboard) — all driven by `_config.yml`, no template edits needed for common tweaks.
- **PWA** — offline support via a service worker (`assets/scripts/sw.js`) and an offline fallback page.

## Use this for your own site

`npm run setup` opens a form in your browser, writes `_config.yml`, and backs up
everything it replaces. Then push to a repo named `username.github.io` and set
Pages → Source → GitHub Actions. The workflow passes the right `baseurl` for
both a user page and a project page, so nothing is hard-coded.

Full instructions, including how to add a collection and how to change what an
entry page is made of: [`.claude/skills/personal-site/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/personal-site/SKILL.md).

## Getting started

```bash
bin/serve      # local dev server + livereload (recommended)
bin/build      # production build into _site/
```

Requires Ruby 3.4 via [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) — the macOS system Ruby (2.6) cannot build this site (`sass-embedded`/`google-protobuf` crash on load). `bin/serve`/`bin/build` force the right Ruby onto `PATH` for you. If you switch Ruby versions: `rm -rf vendor/bundle Gemfile.lock && bundle install`.

For a fast SCSS-only sanity check without spinning up Jekyll:

```bash
npx --yes sass@1.77.8 --no-source-map _sass/main.scss /tmp/out.css
```

There's no test suite, linter, or JS build step — content is plain Markdown/Liquid, and Sass is compiled by `jekyll-sass-converter`.

## Project structure

```
_config.yml         Control center — nav, header/footer options, collections, resume data, adsense
_layouts/            default, page, post, resume
_includes/           header, footer, ad, search modal, home/* section renderers, components/* shortcodes
_sass/im/            the IM CSS framework — tokens, base, navbar, hero, components, motion, resume, sitetree…
_posts/               blog posts (Jekyll's native collection), YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md
_portfolio/ _videos/ _snippets/ _prompts/   the other four collections
assets/               styles, scripts, images, search index
```

Full architecture notes — collection wiring, layout decisions, known gotchas — live in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md). Design tokens, motion conventions, and the shortcode component reference live in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md).

## Content collections

| Collection | Directory | Landing page | Homepage style |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blog | `_posts/` | `/blog/` | Numbered list |
| Portfolio | `_portfolio/` | `/portfolio/` | Gallery |
| Videos | `_videos/` | `/videos/` | Ranked "Top picks" list |
| Snippets | `_snippets/` | `/snippets/` | Compact list |
| Prompts | `_prompts/` | `/prompts/` | Card grid |

Every entry gets `layout: post` by default (see `defaults:` in `_config.yml`), and JSON-LD structured data matching its collection's configured `schema:` (e.g. `BlogPosting`, `VideoObject`, `CreativeWork`).

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/jekyll.yml`, which builds with Ruby 3.1 in production mode and deploys `_site/` to GitHub Pages.
